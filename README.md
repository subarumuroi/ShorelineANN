# ShorelineANN

Neural net and Gaussian Process Regressor methods for learning shoreline model outputs.

Multitester compares models of various types on the same data.

various other methods are available for the group to share and test ideas of the experimental approach.

Model uses shoreline data, exactly 1 year after simulation, with 6 input parameters.
